Carl's Vagrant VM and Dotfiles
==============================

All stored in one convenient place
----------------------------------

I created this so that whenever I have a new web app project,
I can just clone this directory, and start the new project on any computer
as long as I'm using the Virtual Machine. This also means that all my
configuration settings are stored in a single place for ease of access.

Although the Vagrantfile will be updated depending on what projects I start
working on, this should still give me a really good start on having a
consistent work environment no matter what.

### Future thoughts

Soon enough I think I will start adding my CMDER configuration, so that I can
have configuration stored in source control, and just pull down the runtime
from a cloud storage source. This should enable me to work from wherever, 
without having to worry about OS issues.
